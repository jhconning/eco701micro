## Eco 701: Microeconomic Theory, Fall 2017

**Jonathan Conning**
Hunter College, City University of New York

The jupyter notebooks and other materials hosted here are for the above listed economics course.  These materials are hosted both at the [eco701micro](https://github.com/jhconning/eco701micro) github repository and at the [701micro](https://notebooks.azure.com/jhconning/libraries/701micro) Microsoft Azure notebooks library.  You should be able to run the notebooks interactively at the latter library, as described below.

The content can be freely used and reproduced. See the copyright and license notice below.

#### Getting started

Start with the notebook [00 Introduction](https://notebooks.azure.com/jhconning/libraries/701micro/html/notebooks/00+Introduction.ipynb). This should lead you to a static view of the notebook. If you then press 'Run' or 'Clone' Azure you have options to run the content interactively. If you were not already logged in you will be prompted to login or create a free microsoft account on [https://notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com).  Chose 'clone' to copy the entire library to your own account to modify the notebooks interactively and be able to save any changes.

Some notebooks can be put in slideshow mode by pressing Alt-R or clicking the 'Enter/Exit Reveal slideshow' button (must first install [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) first if you are using [jupyter on your own computer](http://jupyter.org/install.html)).


#### Comments, suggestions and corrections

A repository of the notebooks is also maintained at [https://github.com/jhconning/eco701micro](https://github.com/jhconning/eco701micro).
Please report any errors or suggestions as [an issue](https://github.com/jhconning/eco701micro/issues)
